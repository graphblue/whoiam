## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Best Use: Claude Code** (Recommended)

1. **Install Claude Code** (if you haven't already)
   ```bash
   # Follow instructions at https://claude.ai/code
   ```

2. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/graphblue/whoiam.git
   cd whoiam
   ```

3. **Load the agent prompt**
   - Open `HAM-PROFILE-AGENT.md` in Claude Code
   - The agent will automatically understand the full context

4. **Start designing!**
   ```
   You: "I want to create a profile page for my callsign YO3GPH"
   Agent: "73! Let's create your profile. Do you have a sketch or vision in mind?"
   ```

### **Alternative: Other AI Assistants**

This agent prompt works with other AI assistants (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.), though Claude Code provides the best experience due to its superior code generation and file handling capabilities.

**To use with other AI:**
1. Copy the content of `HAM-PROFILE-AGENT.md`
2. Paste it into your AI assistant
3. Add: "Please act as this agent and help me create a ham radio profile page"
4. Provide your callsign and preferences

## 🎓 **How It Works**

### **Step 1: Vision Capture**
The agent asks how you want to work:
- **Upload a sketch** 📐 - Hand-drawn design? No problem!
- **Describe your vision** 💭 - "I want my callsign huge with Romanian colors..."
- **Guided questions** ❓ - Not sure? We'll ask the right questions

### **Step 2: Information Gathering**
```
- Callsign: Your amateur radio callsign
- Name: Your name
- Location: QTH, Grid Locator (e.g., KN32AL)
- Equipment: Radios, antennas, amplifiers
- Preferences: Favorite bands, modes, activities
- License Class: Including HAREC/CEPT for international operators
```

### **Step 3: Design & Generation**
The agent:
1. Detects your country from callsign prefix
2. Suggests flag colors automatically
3. Creates custom layout based on your vision
4. Generates optimized HTML + CSS
5. Ensures everything is under 8KB limit

### **Step 4: Delivery**
You receive:
- `callsign-profile.html` - Your complete page
- `callsign.css` - Minified CSS (ready to upload)
- `callsign-readable.css` - Human-readable version for editing
- `README.md` - Upload instructions

## ❓ **FAQ**

### **Q: Can I use this for other platforms?**
A: Yes! While optimized for 8KB CSS platforms, the generated code works anywhere that accepts HTML/CSS.

### **Q: Do I need to know CSS?**
A: No! That's the point. Just describe what you want or upload a sketch.

### **Q: Can I edit the generated CSS?**
A: Absolutely! You receive both minified and readable versions. Edit the readable version, then minify it when done.

### **Q: What if my design exceeds 8KB?**
A: The agent will automatically optimize and suggest what to remove if needed. It prioritizes visual impact.

### **Q: Does this work without Claude Code?**
A: Yes, but Claude Code provides the best experience due to superior code generation and file handling. Other AI assistants work but may require more manual steps.

### **Q: Can I commercial use this?**
A: Yes! MIT License means you can use it freely for personal or commercial purposes.

### **Q: What about JavaScript widgets (QRZ stats, ClubLog)?**
A: Platform blocks JavaScript, but you can embed iframe widgets from services that support them. See `PLATFORM-LIMITS.md` for details.
